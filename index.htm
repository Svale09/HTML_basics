      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <p>
        Hatake Kakashi was born as a son of a great and respected Konoha Shinobi
        known as the White Fang. <br />
        He loved his father and he looked up to him, wanting to become a grat
        shinobi like his father <br />
        One day a tragedy happened, his father sacrificed the mission in order
        to save his comrades. Even though he saved lives of manz of his shinobi
        comrades the village frowned upon him. The White Fang couldn't handle
        the embarassment and killed himself.

        After his fathers death Kakashi decided to follow all of the rules. He
        washed his house every day, he knew how to cook very well, all in all he
        was very disciplined. <br />
        That discipline eventually led to his recognition by his sensei and the
        Hokage at the time: Minato Namikaze. Minato decided to put him in the
        ANBU to heal his heart of the sorrow he felt. But what he didn't know is
        that the time itself is the only thing that can heal a broken heart.
